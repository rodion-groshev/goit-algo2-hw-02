## Task 1. Optimising the 3D printer queue in a university laboratory

> Develop a program to optimise the 3D printing job queue based on the priorities and technical limitations of the printer using a greedy algorithm.

#### Task description:

-    Take into account job priorities.
-    Group models for simultaneous printing.
-    Check volume and quantity limits.
-    Calculate the total print time.
-    Return the optimal printing order.


## Task 2: The optimal cutting of the rod for maximum profit (Rod Cutting Problem)

> Develop a program to find the optimal way to cut the rod to maximise profit. Two approaches should be implemented: through recursion with memoisation and through tabulation.

#### Task description

-   The input is the length of a rod and an array of prices, where price[i] is the price of a rod of length i+1 .

-   Determine how to cut the rod to maximise the profit.

-   Implement both approaches of dynamic programming.

-   Print the optimal cutting method and the maximum profit.
